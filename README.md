# Supervised Learning Algorithms
This repository serves as a guide to learning and implementing supervised learning algorithms in machine learning. The journey starts with basic models and progresses to more advanced techniques.

# Algorithms Covered
1. Linear Regression – Understanding relationships between variables and making continuous predictions.

2. Decision Tree – A tree-based model for classification and regression tasks.

3. Logistic Regression – A statistical model for binary classification problems.

4. Random Forest – An ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees.

5. Support Vector Machine (SVM) – A powerful classifier that works well in high-dimensional spaces.

6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – A simple and effective classification algorithm.

7. Naïve Bayes – A probabilistic model based on Bayes’ theorem.

8. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) – Advanced boosting algorithms for better performance.

# Learning Plan
Conceptual Understanding – Learn the theory behind each algorithm.

Implementation – Apply the models using Python libraries like sklearn and xgboost.

Performance Evaluation – Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Hyperparameter Tuning – Optimize models using techniques like GridSearchCV.

Real-World Applications – Work on datasets like loan approval, medical diagnosis, and customer segmentation.
